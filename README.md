# GPX-and-HRM-to-TCX-file-converter
Convert HRM and GPX files to TCX file 

My program combines the GPX file and the HRM file into a TCX file.
Currently, only the heart rate is taken from the HRM file. 
Altitude, cadence, etc. is not considered. However, this is enough so that I
could use my old Polar RC3 GPS watch to load my workouts into Strava. Unfortunately, I do not have the opportunity
to experience how my program will work with files of other devices, so USE IT WITH CAUTION!
